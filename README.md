# Medical Specialty Classification with T5
T5 ("Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer") is an encoder-decoder based model which was shown to be useful for many NLP tasks.\ The base of the work is a pretrained model on a large scale English text dataset. In this notebook, we finetune it to the task of medical specialty classification.
